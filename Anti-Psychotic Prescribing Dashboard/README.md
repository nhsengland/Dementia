# Anti-Psychotic Prescribing Dashboard

Please note this information is experimental and it is only intended for use for management purposes.

This repository contains the SQL script for the Anti-Psychotic Prescribing Dashboard, which calculates upper and lower control limits and the pbar for statistical process control (SPC) charts. The output table from this script is used in tableau to produce a dashboard.

A p chart (type of SPC) has been used to monitor changes in anti-psychotic prescription for those with and those without a psychosis diagnosis over time using the formulae outlined here: https://sixsigmastudyguide.com/p-attribute-charts/

Data from May 2020 to the lastest available month is used.
